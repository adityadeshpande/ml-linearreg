# # ml-linear reg
Getting my hands on Machine Learning. (for personal skill development, nothing fancy here!)

So for my understanding purpose, I have taken a simple example of daily food count in an office against the wastage of food and I am trying to establish a relationship in between the food and the wastage per cent.
I am following the linear regression algorithm for this evaluation.
